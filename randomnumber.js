See if you can build a program that collects a number from a user,
then prints out a random number from 1 to the number the user selects.
Now is the opportunity to practice using some of the commands you learned in this course.*/


var theNumber = parseInt(prompt("Pick a number"))
oneToNum = Math.random()

console.log(oneToNum, 'is a random number less than', theNumber)
